Visualization 1: Pie Chart in Python

What Software Did You Use to Create Your Data Visualization?
I used Python with the Matplotlib library to create a pie chart.

Who Is Your Intended Audience?
The intended audience is policymakers and economic analysts who need a clear and concise representation of GDP distribution among different goods-producing industries.

What Information or Message Are You Trying to Convey with Your Visualization?
The pie chart shows the proportion of GDP contributed by various goods-producing industries in Ontario for the year 2023. It helps to visualize which industries are the largest contributors to the GDP and their relative sizes.

What Design Principles Did You Consider When Making Your Visualization?
Substantive: Focused on presenting accurate data for 2023. Included only industries with non-null GDP values to ensure meaningful data.
Perceptual: Used contrasting colors to differentiate between industries clearly. Added percentage labels for better understanding.
Aesthetic: Designed the chart with a clean and simple layout to enhance readability. Applied a starting angle to provide a clear initial perspective.
How Did You Ensure That Your Data Visualizations Are Reproducible?
The code for generating the pie chart is written in Python, making it easily reproducible if the same dataset is used. All necessary steps, including data extraction and visualization, are included in the code.

How Did You Ensure That Your Data Visualization Is Accessible?
Ensured accessibility by using distinct colors and including percentage labels, which help users with color vision deficiencies understand the chart. The title clearly describes the content of the chart.
